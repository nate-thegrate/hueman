### I want to use the game's music

Cool, go ahead! The music is published under a [CC Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/): if you give credit I would very much appreciate it.

Ideally, something like "music is from the ʜᴜᴇman OST", with a link to [hue-man.app](https://hue-man.app/).

### I want to copy part of the code

Go for it—no need to ask permission or give credit.

### I want to copy the whole game and modify it

Sounds like fun! Make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nate-thegrate/hueman/issues/new?template=anything.md) and let me know what you want to do.

I'll get back to you probably within a couple days, and definitely within a week. If it's been 7 days since you posted the issue and I haven't responded, feel free to proceed with whatever you were planning to do.
