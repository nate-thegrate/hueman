### I want to use the game's music

Cool, go ahead! If you give credit I would very much appreciate it.

Ideally, something like "music is from the ʜᴜᴇman OST by Nate Wilson", with a link to [hue-man.app](https://hue-man.app/).

### I want to copy a small part of the code

Go for it—no need to ask permission or give credit.

### I want to copy a big part of the game (or copy the entire thing and modify it)

Sounds like fun! Make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nate-thegrate/hueman/issues) and let me know what you want to do.

I'll get back to you probably within a couple days, and definitely within a week. If it's been 7 days since you posted the issue and I haven't responded, feel free to proceed with whatever you were planning to do.
