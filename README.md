### FAQ

> What's the target age range?

ʜᴜᴇman is for all humans! The ideal target audience is probably people in middle- or high-school. Younger kids might think some parts are too difficult; older people will enjoy it but may find it slightly patronizing.

<br>

> How did you release it on so many platforms?

This game was made using Flutter: an open-source, cross-platform app framework made by Google.

If you're interested in Flutter game development, you can see my code by going to the [`lib/`](lib/) folder, and you can head over to [flutter.dev/games](https://flutter.dev/games) to start your own project.

<br>

> How did you make the music?

[MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) is an open-source program for writing sheet music, and it has good sound quality too. [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools) is an expensive digital audio workstation that I bought back in 2016.

Some songs were just made with MuseScore, and I used Pro Tools for others. If you're interested in music production, I recommend looking at [some options](https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+audio+workstation+options) to see what fits with your goals & budget.

> Is it really 100% free? Can I donate?

Refusing to accept your money feeds my ego.

### bugs & glitches

Many bugs have been fixed, thanks to some extensive playtesting :)

If you notice something wrong, feel free to make a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nate-thegrate/hueman/issues/new?template=report-a-bug.md) for it! Or if you don't have a GitHub account, you can use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZgqN19eIaV-MBxDuOAkcLfsZs7HHS_Wu_PCJVdTPBVC9Bkg/viewform) instead.

Currently, there are a couple of minor platform-specific issues:

- **PC/Mac:** no known issues!
- **iPhone:** just a few small visual glitches involving partially transparent stuff.
- **Android:** sometimes there's a bit of audio delay. If you're using an older device and the app isn't performing well, go to "settings" and turn off the music.
